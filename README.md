The main objective of this project was to practice Client-side routing and React Tests.
The design was loosely inspired by the Bape online store.

## What I've Learned
- Single page routing using React-Router.
- Using the accessibility tree to find roles for React test.
- React testing with Vitest.
- Displaying the same content on every page using nested routes, and Outlet components for different content.
- CSS modules to separate styling with the same classnames.
- Displaying an item page, using dynamic segments.
